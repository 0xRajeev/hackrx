# HackRx

HackRx is the first onchain "Ethereum Security Channel" (ESC) for security-critical communication among protocol participants.

## Why?

Security-critical communication among Ethereum protocol participants continues to use traditional Web2-centric platforms such as Twitter/X, Discord and Telegram, which are not: onchain, transparent, open-source, decentralized, censorship-resistant and privacy-sensitive. All top-ten REKT leaderboard exploits, which amount to billions of dollars in losses, were announced on Twitter! We need a web3-native alternative that addresses all these fundamental shortcomings. To onboard the next billion users, the Ethereum community deserves much better security and a dedicated onchain channel for its communications.

## What?

HackRx is the onchain "Ethereum Security Channel" (ESC) for security-critical communication among protocol participants. Protocols register with HackRx to notify their participants about security-critical information, which includes risk-mitigation measures pre-hack and loss-mitigation measures post-hack. Ethereum users register with HackRx to receive authoritative security-critical notifications from all the protocols they are interested in or with which they interact. HackRx is thus a prescription from protocol & security experts for Ethereum security incidents analogous to Rx which is a prescription from medical experts for health security issues. All messages on HackRx are stored onchain in a transparent, decentralized and censorship-resistant manner, thus making it a permissionless onchain "Ethereum Security Channel" (ESC) for security-critical communication among protocol participants.

## How?

At EthIndia 2023's EthGlobal hackathon, we are demonstrating the feasibility of this simple but powerful idea by building a strawman PoC using smart contracts integrated with the Push protocol APIs.
